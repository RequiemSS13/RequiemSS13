//A system to manage and display alerts on screen without needing you to do it yourself

//PUBLIC -  call these wherever you want

/**
 *Proc to create or update an alert. Returns the alert if the alert is new or updated, 0 if it was thrown already
 *category is a text string. Each mob may only have one alert per category; the previous one will be replaced
 *path is a type path of the actual alert type to throw
 *severity is an optional number that will be placed at the end of the icon_state for this alert
 *for example, high pressure's icon_state is "highpressure" and can be serverity 1 or 2 to get "highpressure1" or "highpressure2"
 *new_master is optional and sets the alert's icon state to "template" in the ui_style icons with the master as an overlay.
 *flicks are forwarded to master
 *override makes it so the alert is not replaced until cleared by a clear_alert with clear_override, and it's used for hallucinations.
