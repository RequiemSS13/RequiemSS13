Your command can be as long as you like within the character limit, and may be detailed and complex, but should be a single command. Their player decides how they interpret your command and when it is complete- please use clear, direct language for best effect. Their player can choose to reject your command for any reason- please ensure your command is not boring, uncomfortable, or against the rules. You cannot alter memories with this power, though you can force your target to act as though their memories were different. The text of your command is readable by staff. Please keep our consent guidelines in mind while using this power."
